In preparation for Black Friday 2023, we are implementing crucial measures to enhance the resilience and stability of our services. As part of these efforts, we will temporarily suspend automatic updates and distribution of new app versions. This means that if a new version of an app is released and deployed on the VTEX IO platform, the app will not undergo automatic installation and updating across the accounts that use the app.

## When will the freeze occur?

The suspension of automatic app distribution is scheduled as follows:

- **Start date:** Thursday, November 23rd at 1 PM (BRT)
- **End date:** Saturday, November 25th at 1 PM (BRT)

## How can I update the app version installed in an account during the freeze period?

If you need to update an installed app during the freeze period, you can manually install the specific app version in the desired VTEX accounts. Please refer to the [Installing apps on live stores](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-apps-in-live-stores-best-practices) guide for more information.
